## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the playbook file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting access to the network.

- _What aspect of security do load balancers protect?_
	- Load balancers off-loading functionality has the potential to deflect DDOS attacks. 
	- Shift attack traffic from corporate servers to public cloud providers.

- _What is the advantage of a jump box?_
    - Advantages: is that it allows admins to minimize attacks surface thus making an attack harder. 
	- Is an hardened and monitored device that provides a controlled means of access between two dissimilar security zones.
		
Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the file logs and system metrics traffic.

- *What does Filebeat watch for?*
    - Filebeat is designed to watch for and ship log files and forwards the data to Elasticsearch for indexing.
	- It's actually a logging agent that is installed on a server that is generating log files. 

- *What does Metricbeat record?*
	- Metricbeat monitors and collects statics and metrics from the servers' system and services running on that server. 
	- Monitors the standard cpu/memory/disk/network metric data, also records:
		- Apache
		- Docker
		- Nginx
		- MySQL
		- Redis, etc

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- _Whitelisted IP addresses:_   
	-  137.116.191.67 <br>
	   13.64.143.93   <br>
	   13.90.43.141

### RedTeam NSG Firewall rules:

### ELK NSG Firewall rules: 
![ELK_NSG](https://github.com/goosee007/CyberSecurity-XpreTech/blob/main/Images/ELK_NSG%20Rules.PNG "ELK NSG")


Machines within the network can only be accessed by Jump Box via ansible container using its private IP address 10.0.0.4. 
<br>Access to the DVWA web site is through the Load Balancers by navigating to the public IP address 13.64.143.93.
<br>Access to the Kibana web site is through the resource group firewall and navigate to the public IP address 13.90.43.141 on port 5601. 

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly <br>Accessible | Allowed IP<br>Addresses | Ports |
|----------|-------------------------|:-----------------------:|-------|
| Jump Box |           Yes           |      137.116.191.67     |   22  |
| Web-1    |           Yes           |       13.64.143.93      |   80  |
| Web-2    |           Yes           |       13.64.143.93      |   80  |
| Web-3    |           Yes           |       13.64.143.93      |   80  |
| ELK      |           Yes           |       13.90.43.141      |  5601 |


### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because
of its simplicity and being Agentless...

The playbook implements the following tasks:  
- _The steps of the ELK installation play:_
- ... Install docker image docker.io, this will install docker image
- ... Install python image python3-pip, this is to install python image 
- ... Install docker module, this will install the docker container
- ... Increase memory allocation, this will configure memory allocation
- ... Download and launch a docker elk container and publish ports, install elk container and configure connection ports

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:

| Monitoring | IP Addresses |
|------------|--------------|
| Jump Box   | 10.0.0.4     |
| Web-1      | 10.0.0.5     |
| Web-2      | 10.0.0.6     |
| Web-3      | 10.0.0.9     |


We have installed the following Beats on these machines:

| Monitoring<br>Name |                     Beat<br>Service                     |
|:------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|
| Jump Box           | -Metricbeat: Apache Metric<br>-Filebeat:   Apache log   |
| Web-1              | -Metricbeat: Docker Metrics<br>-Filebeat:   System Logs |
| Web-2              | -Metricbeat: Docker Metrics<br>-Filebeat:   System Logs |
| Web-3              | -Metricbeat: Docker Metrics<br>-Filebeat:   System Logs |
| ELK                | -Metricbeat: Docker Metrics<br>-Filebeat:   System Logs |

Beats is an open platform lightweight data shipper of all kinds of data and sends the data from many machines and systems to Logstash or Elasticsearch. 

Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:  
- _For example: the kind of data each beat collects and what you would expect to see, to name a couple of them here,
E.g.,

`Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

`Filebeat System` collects Syslog logs files, syslogs are designed to monitor network devices and systems.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:   
- Copy the /etc/ansible/filebeat-config.yml file to the WebVM's where filebeat was installed and copied to /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
- Update the hosts in the hosts file to include the IP Addresses of the VM machine where the filebeat will be installed.
Specify the internal IP address: 

E.g.,  10.1.0.4 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

- Run the playbook, and navigate to the Filebeat installation page on the ELK server <public IP address:5601> GUI to check that the installation worked as expected.

_**Bonus**, some specific commands that you will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._

To download filebeat configuration file:
`curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/slape/5cc350109583af6cbe577bbcc0710c93/raw/eca603b72586fbe148c11f9c87bf96a63cb25760/Filebeat > filebeat-config.yml`

To run the playbook file, use the following commands:
- `ansible-playbook filebeat-playbook.yml`  

To verify the playbook: 
- `ansible-playbook --syntax-check`

To check the status and start filebeat and metric services:
- `service filebeat status`
- `service filebeat start`
- `service metricbeat status`
- `service metricbeat start`
